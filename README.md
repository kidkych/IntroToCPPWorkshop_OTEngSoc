# IntroToCPPWorkshop_OTEngSoc
The example program written during the Introduction to C++ workshop held with OTEngsoc on February 25.

### Note:
The code has been updated since the workshop. Comments were added and a bug that I missed when it came to the year calculation for question 31 was fixed (needed to cast a integer to double, line 45)
